# ALF Health Incident Prediction Project

## 🏥 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict next-day health incidents for Assisted Living Facility (ALF) residents. By analyzing daily health metrics and patient characteristics, the model helps facility managers proactively identify at-risk residents and optimize resource allocation.

**Key Objective**: Predict `incident_next_day` (binary classification) to enable preventive interventions.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The project uses synthetic data simulating real ALF health records with the following fields:

- **Patient Information**: `patient_id`, `facility_id`, `age`, `gender`, `diagnosis`
- **Vital Signs**: `heart_rate`, `blood_pressure_sys`, `blood_pressure_dia`, `temperature`
- **Care Metrics**: `med_adherence` (0.0 to 1.0 scale)
- **Target Variable**: `incident_next_day` (1 = incident, 0 = no incident)
- **Temporal**: `date` (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### Dataset Statistics:
- **200 unique patients** across 5 facilities
- **90 days** of daily records (January 1 - March 30, 2024)
- **18,000 total records**
- **31.4% incident rate** (class imbalance noted)

## 🛠️ 2. Feature Preparation

### Engineered Features
The project creates 15+ additional features to enhance prediction:

#### Personal Baseline Deviations
- `hr_deviation`: Absolute deviation from patient's average heart rate
- `bp_sys_deviation`: Systolic BP deviation from personal baseline
- `temp_deviation`: Temperature deviation from normal

#### Temporal Features
- `heart_rate_3d_avg`: 3-day rolling average of heart rate
- `bp_sys_3d_avg`: 3-day rolling BP average
- `temp_3d_avg`: 3-day rolling temperature average
- `heart_rate_change`: Daily change in heart rate
- `bp_sys_change`: Daily change in systolic BP
- `temp_change`: Daily temperature change

#### Risk Indicators (Binary Flags)
- `high_hr`: Heart rate > 100 bpm
- `low_hr`: Heart rate < 60 bpm
- `high_bp`: Systolic BP > 140 mmHg
- `low_bp`: Systolic BP < 90 mmHg
- `fever`: Temperature > 37.5°C
- `low_med_adherence`: Medication adherence < 0.8

#### Composite Features
- `vital_risk_score`: Sum of all risk indicators (0-6 scale)
- `days_since_incident`: Days since last health incident
- `is_weekend`: Weekend indicator (different staffing patterns)
- `age_diagnosis_risk`: Interaction between age and diagnosis severity

### Missing Value Handling
- **Strategy**: Median imputation for vital signs
- **Rationale**: Preserves distribution, robust to outliers
- **Implementation**: Applied after feature engineering to maintain temporal relationships
## 🤖 3. Modeling

### Data Splitting Strategy
**Critical**: Patient-based splitting to prevent data leakage
- Uses `GroupShuffleSplit` to ensure patients don't appear in both train and test sets
- **80/20 split**: 160 patients training, 40 patients testing
- **Rationale**: Simulates real-world scenario where model predicts for new patients

### Models Trained
1. **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)
   - Simple, interpretable
   - Fast training and inference
   - Provides probability calibration baseline

2. **Random Forest** (primary model)
   - Handles non-linear relationships
   - Robust to outliers
   - Provides feature importance rankings
   - 100 trees with balanced class weights

### Model Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | Why This Metric? |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Accuracy** | 68.5% | 66.9% | Overall correctness |
| **Precision** | 50.3% | 40.9% | When model alerts, how often is it right? |
| **Recall** | 6.4% | 11.5% | What % of actual incidents are caught? |
| **F1-Score** | 11.4% | 17.9% | Balance of precision/recall |
| **AUC** | 0.621 | 0.608 | Overall discrimination ability |

### Why These Metrics?
- **AUC chosen as primary metric**: Handles class imbalance well
- **Precision important**: Minimize false alarms to prevent alert fatigue
- **Recall critical**: Missing real incidents has serious consequences
- **Trade-off**: Model is conservative (high precision, lower recall)

### Feature Scaling
- StandardScaler applied to all numeric features
- Ensures equal feature contribution
- Critical for Logistic Regression convergence

### Top 3 Most Important Features
Based on Random Forest feature importance:

1. **Blood Pressure Systolic Deviation (6.25%)** 
   - Deviations from personal baseline more predictive than absolute values
   - Indicates cardiovascular instability

2. **Heart Rate Deviation (6.19%)**
   - Personal baseline comparison crucial
   - Captures both tachycardia and bradycardia risks

3. **Temperature Deviation (6.18%)**
   - Even small deviations (>1°C) highly predictive
   - Early indicator of infection or inflammation

### Practical Insights for Facility Managers

#### 🎯 Daily Monitoring Priorities
1. **Focus on Deviations, Not Absolutes**
   - Establish personal baselines for each resident
   - Flag deviations: HR >20 bpm, BP >20 mmHg, Temp >1°C
   
2. **High-Risk Patient Profiles**
   - COPD patients: 41.8% incident rate (2x average)
   - Dementia patients: 39.5% incident rate
   - Recent incident history: Higher recurrence risk
   - Medication adherence <70%: Strong predictor

3. **Intervention Timing**
   - Use 3-day trend analysis for early warning
   - Weekend periods need extra vigilance
   - Morning vital checks most predictive

#### 📋 Implementation Recommendations

1. **Risk Stratification Protocol**
   - Focus resources on top 20% risk scores
   - Daily review of high-risk residents
   - Automated alerts for threshold breaches

2. **Preventive Measures**
   - Medication adherence programs for at-risk patients
   - Enhanced monitoring for COPD/Dementia residents
   - Personalized vital sign thresholds

3. **Model Integration**
   - Use as decision support, not replacement for clinical judgment
   - Monthly retraining with new data
   - Track model performance metrics
   - Adjust thresholds based on facility-specific patterns

### Key Takeaway
**The model's strength lies in identifying deviations from personal baselines rather than absolute thresholds.** This aligns with clinical best practices and provides actionable insights for preventive care.
